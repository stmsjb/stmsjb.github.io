  <h3>Theoretical Symposium Poster</h3>
  </header>
  <p>My symposium poster is based around the cancellations that occurred in various forms of entertainment; those being theater, film, literature, and music. Seeing as theater was one of my topics I chose to model my poster off of the iconic Playbill one would receive at a show. Doing so would attract those who would be interested in the topics of my symposium as they would recognize the parody. As well as this, choosing to parody the playbill allowed me to play around in matching the style; choosing fonts as well as hierarchy that matches the inside of one of these famous pamphlets.</p>

  <h3>Digital Illustration: Mystical Symmetry</h3>
  </header>
  <p>This digital illustration was made on the iPad using an apple pancil and the app procreate. The illustration itself is made up of various symbols and pieces that pull from nature and pagan practices.</p>

  <h3>Album Redesign</h3>
  </header>
  <p>The album I chose to redesign is In Sickness and In Flames by The Front Bottoms. This 2020 release gets its name from the events that have occurred this year and it’s songs range from angry and fast, to sad and slow, to happy and upbeat. The design for my record primarily comes from the genre of the music which is folk punk as well as how the music makes me feel. That being said, I went about this design through the use of digital illustration to create all of the visuals on my album. As for the typography I used various forms of Gill Sans all across the album. I wanted the text to be simple so that the illustration could be the star of the project.</p>

  <h3>Animated Lyrics</h3>
  </header>
  <p>The animated lyrics come from the song Make Way on my album. The main connections to my album are the night sky with the same circular stars. Another minor connection is the use of Gill Sans as the fonts in the animation. The background was made through stop motion animation to add an extra element of movement. The text being a coral color came about to separate the animation a tad from the album itself as well as to make the text stand out from the background. I also chose to play off of the repetition of the word “nobody” throughout the song as sometimes it is front and center while others it is merely in the background.</p>
